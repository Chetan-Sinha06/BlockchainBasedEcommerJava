							<h2 class="subheading mb-4">Blockchain is a method in which
								a confirmation of a transaction is kept by means of a
								crypto-currency. The record is maintained transversely, linking
								several computers in a peer to peer network. Contracts,
								transactions, and the records of them define the economic system
								of a country. They set boundaries and provide security to the
								assets. Considering the features of blockchain such as
								immutability and maintaining the footage of transaction details,
								this paper highlights the usage of blockchain technology with
								farmerâ€™s portal that keep the footage of selling and buying
								information of crops</h2>
